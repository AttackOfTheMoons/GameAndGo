## Nickname

## Description
Game and Go will be an online web store that anyone can access after creating an account to search for any games sorted by genera and by the console of their choosing. With this application, the entire process of finding a game for your console, specific genera you enjoy, and even ensuring that your brand new custom built can run the games with those crispy 60 frames per second, it truly is a one-stop shop for all gamers. You will be welcomed and asked a series of questions in order to guide you through the shopping process to make for an exquisite online shopping experience. Once you land on your title and preferred console with the affirmation that you can run it you will be able to browse through hundreds of reviews before finally pulling the trigger on the purchase of your new game.
